# MongoDB updateOne() returns modifiedCount 0
This repository demonstrates a common issue with MongoDB's `updateOne()` method where it returns a `modifiedCount` of 0 even when a document is expected to be updated.  The problem often stems from discrepancies in the filter criteria or data type mismatches between the filter and the document's fields.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to update a document using `updateOne()`.  Under certain conditions, such as incorrect filter values, the update fails silently, and `modifiedCount` remains 0. This can be misleading as it suggests no update occurred when in reality, there might be a problem with the update logic.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution.  It carefully reviews and corrects the filter criteria to accurately target the intended document. It also adds comprehensive error handling and logging to diagnose potential issues.  It also demonstrates how to handle potential errors gracefully.
